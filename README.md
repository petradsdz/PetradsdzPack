A Malverk mod that replaces Jokers and Deck Backs with my own art work, referencing other media

# Download instructions
1. Download and install [Balatro Mod Manager](https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-manager) 
2. Within the Mod Manager, search for and install Steamodded, and [Malverk](https://balatromods.miraheze.org/wiki/Malverk)
3. Now copy this folder (Titled Petradsdz Pack) into %AppData%\Balatro\Mods\

You'll know it works if the Textures tab appears in your main menu and you see a retextured Brainstorm (That's me!)

Enjoy!
